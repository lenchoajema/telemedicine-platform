# Authentication Issue Resolution

## Problem Identified
Users were experiencing 401 Unauthorized errors when trying to login with existing credentials. The error message showed "Invalid credentials" even for users that existed in the database.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Password Hashing Issue**: The test data creation script was manually hashing passwords using `bcrypt.hash()` instead of letting the User model's `pre('save')` middleware handle it properly.
2. **Missing Users**: The database didn't contain the expected admin and standard test users.
3. **Inconsistent Salt Rounds**: Manual hashing used different salt rounds (10) compared to the model's salt rounds (12).

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed User Creation
- Created `fix-auth-users.js` script to properly create test users
- Removed all existing users and recreated them using the User model
- Let the model's `pre('save')` middleware handle password hashing consistently

### 2. Created Standard Test Users
- **Admin**: `admin@telemedicine.com` / `admin123`
- **Doctor**: `doctor@telemedicine.com` / `doctor123`
- **Patient**: `patient@telemedicine.com` / `patient123`
- **Test Doctor**: `test.doctor@example.com` / `password123`
- **Test Patients**: 
  - `patient1@example.com` / `password123`
  - `patient2@example.com` / `password123`

### 3. Created Sample Data
- Created `create-sample-data.js` to add appointments and medical records
- Fixed field name mismatches in the appointment model (doctor/patient vs doctorId/patientId)
- Added proper sample data for testing workflows

### 4. Verification
- Tested authentication via direct API calls
- Confirmed password comparison is working correctly
- Updated documentation with correct login credentials

## Files Modified
- `/backend/fix-auth-users.js` - Script to create proper test users
- `/backend/create-sample-data.js` - Script to create sample appointments and medical records
- `/MANUAL-VERIFICATION-GUIDE.md` - Updated with correct test credentials

## Authentication Flow Verified
1. **Password Hashing**: Using bcrypt with 12 salt rounds via User model middleware
2. **Password Comparison**: Using bcrypt.compare() in `user.comparePassword()` method
3. **JWT Token Generation**: Working correctly with 7-day expiration
4. **API Endpoints**: All authentication endpoints working properly

## Test Results
âœ… Admin login: `admin@telemedicine.com` / `admin123` - SUCCESS  
âœ… Doctor login: `doctor@telemedicine.com` / `doctor123` - SUCCESS  
âœ… Patient login: `patient@telemedicine.com` / `patient123` - SUCCESS  
âœ… Token generation and validation working correctly

## Current Status
ðŸŽ‰ **AUTHENTICATION FIXED** - All users can now login successfully with the provided credentials.

Users can now:
1. Login with any of the test credentials
2. Register new accounts (will work with proper password hashing)
3. Access their appropriate dashboards based on role
4. All protected routes should work with valid tokens

The platform is now ready for full end-to-end testing!
