```

### Next Steps: Manual Verification
1. **Open Frontend**: Navigate to http://localhost:5173
2. **Test Registration**: Create new patient and doctor accounts
3. **Test Patient Flow**: Login → Dashboard → Book Appointment → View Records
4. **Test Doctor Flow**: Login → Dashboard → Manage Appointments → Set Availability
5. **Test Navigation**: Verify all links and page transitions work
6. **Test Responsiveness**: Check mobile and tablet views
7. **Test Error Handling**: Try invalid inputs and network failures

### Success Criteria
The platform will be considered fully functional when:
- ✅ All services start without errors
- ✅ Users can register and login successfully
- ✅ Patients can discover doctors and book appointments
- ✅ Doctors can manage their schedule and patients
- ✅ All navigation works correctly
- ✅ Data persists properly in the database
- ✅ Error handling works appropriately
- ✅ UI is responsive and user-friendly

### Support Materials
- **Debug Script**: `bash debug-start.sh` for troubleshooting
- **Test Script**: `bash test-functionality.sh` for API testing
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:5000/api/health
- **Container Status**: `docker-compose ps`
- **Logs**: `docker-compose logs [service]`
