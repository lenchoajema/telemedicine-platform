echo "‚úÖ Changed: setDoctors(Array.isArray(data) ? data : []);"

echo "- NewAppointmentModal should now show available doctors in dropdown"
echo "- AppointmentCard should display doctor names (already has proper fallback logic)"

echo -e "\n5. Next steps:"
echo "- Refresh the frontend to see the updated doctor selection in appointment form"
echo "- The appointments list should show doctor names if the appointments have proper doctor data"
